description: "Starting a blog — what I want to write about and why."

After years of meaning to, I'm finally putting words on the internet.

## What this is

This blog is somewhere to think out loud. I work as a software developer in
London's financial sector, and I spend a lot of time sitting with problems that
don't have clean solutions. Writing is how I make sense of them.

I plan to write about:

- **Software** — design patterns, tools I find useful, things I've learned the
  hard way.
- **Finance** — how markets actually work, books I've read, ideas worth stress-testing.
- **Miscellany** — whatever else seems worth writing down.

Posts will vary in length and formality. Some will be polished essays, others
barely more than a note to my future self.

## Why now

Partly because I finally built the site (you're looking at it). Partly because
I've been reading more and thinking more, and the ideas need somewhere to go.

There's a certain accountability that comes with publishing publicly — even if
nobody reads it, the possibility that someone might sharpens the thinking.

## Who this is for

Primarily me. If you find something useful here, that's a bonus.

More soon.
